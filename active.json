* Notes:
* 1) Please fill out all the information. If we need to contact you for legal purposes, we will do so through the email you provide.
*    * If you are uncomfortable with sharing your email, you can share a link or reference to *two or more* social media accounts (e.g. twitter, discord, dev.to, etc.)
*    * If your contact information is dead or unreachable, we may open your subdomain back up.
* 2) Your domain has to match your project (with exceptions for special purposes)
*    * For example, we would grant the username `eri` to a github account with the project name `eri2` or `eri.js` or `eri-rs` but not to the project name `maki`.
* 3) There has to be a reasonable amount of content on your page. This is to make sure there is a purpose for it and to help stop potential abuse.
